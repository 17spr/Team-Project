# Team-Project
A project by Mostafa, Jamie, Alex, and Jesse @ UNCC Coding Bootcamp. 

====================================================================

    High-level pseudocode of our ideas:

    *  Set up the HTML wireframe with the essential elements (head, title, body, etc)
    *  Add navigation, search bar, maybe a jumbotron, footer, etc
    *  style with css (classic CSS or library of choice - Bootstrap, Materialize, etc)
    *  link JS file to HTML file 
    *  locate our API links (Ticket Master, Google Maps, Lyft, and/or Uber)
    *  create developer accounts and generate API keys if needed 
    *  use Firebase to host our website
    *  target HTML id tags to capture user input in search bar
    *  when user location and their desired events are searched for ("concerts in Seattle", for example)... =>
    *  capture that ^ input with jQuery and then... =>
    *  initiate Google Maps API to display map with geotags (pinpoints) of desired events (concerts, etc)
    *  when user selects an event on the map... =>
    *  initiate Google Maps API for calculating distance/ETA from user location to desired event and...
    *  initiate display of Ticket Master options for selected event
    *  when user selects a ticket option to purchase from Ticket Master... =>
    *  go to complete purchase page
    *  upon clicking confirm purchase button... =>
    *  display appealing modal popup that urges the user to schedule their Uber/Lyft "right now" if they
        intend to drink alcohol at the event and included in the modal should be 
            - reminder that it's unsafe to drink and drive 
            - reminder of legal consequences (much more expensive than just paying for Uber/Lyft)
            - button to schedule Uber in advance
            - button to schedule Lyft in advance
